Petal Correlation: Petal length and petal width have a very high correlation (nearly 0.96), meaning they move together closely.
Species Balance: The dataset is perfectly balanced with 50 samples for each of the three Iris species.
Important Features: Petal measurements appear more useful for predicting species than sepal measurements due to clearer separation in data.
